Since regression analysis is such a fundamental component of inferences, I thought it would be a good idea to try to work through a few more examples to give you some more practice.  

For this we will use some data on flights into and out of Newark (EWR), JFK, and La Guardia airports in NYC metropolitan area.

```{r}
summary( flights) 
flights |> 
  filter( carrier == "EV" ) |>
  mutate( DTH = paste( month, day, hour(time_hour), sep="." ) ) |>
  select( dep_delay, DTH ) -> df1
names( df1 )

```

We also have some data related to local weather conditions.

```{r}
summary( weather )
weather |>
  mutate( DTH = paste( month, day, hour(time_hour), sep = "." ) ) |>
  filter( origin == "JFK") |>
  select( -year, -month, -day, -hour, -time_hour, -origin) -> df2 
names(df2)
```


```{r}
merge( df1, df2, by = "DTH") -> df 
summary( df )
```




# Question

What weather features best explain departure delays from JFK for `ExpressJet` airlines?


```{r}
df |>
  filter( !is.na( dep_delay ) ) |> 
  filter( !is.na( pressure ) ) |>
  filter( !is.na( wind_dir )) |> 
  select( -wind_gust, -DTH ) -> df
```


## Stepwise Approach

```{r}
cor(df)
```
