## Impetus

Regression is the development of a functional model describing how one (or more) response variables change *due to* systematic changes in one (or more) predictor variables.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:    
 - Conceptually describe the process of least square regression.  
 - Perform a linear regression with one or more predictor variables using the `lm()` function.  
 - Evaluate the fit of the models by examining both the residuals and fitted values.  
 - Describe and implement methods necessary to select the best model from a set of potential candidate models using a metric such as AIC.
